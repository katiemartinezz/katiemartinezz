# Hi there!

I'm Katie, and I take every opportunity to learn. 

I love figuring out how things work and how to make them better. I pick things up quickly and stick with tough problems until theyâ€™re solved.

I bring that mindset to every project so I can learn fast, build real features, and support the team where it counts.

**Fun Fact**: I drink cold brew, with a splash of almond milk, at least once a day.
