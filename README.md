# Hi, I’m Katie 👋  
I build reliable, scalable backend and full-stack systems.

I enjoy breaking down complex problems and understanding how systems behave end to end.

My work spans REST APIs, asynchronous job pipelines, authentication flows, and data-backed services. I’ve also worked on AI-powered applications, web crawling and graph analysis, and machine learning projects, with a focus on correctness, evaluation, and real-world trade-offs.

I value clean, maintainable code, clear abstractions, and systems that behave predictably in production.
